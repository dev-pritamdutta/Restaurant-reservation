📌 Project Overview:
A full-stack restaurant reservation system that allows users to book tables online and provides an admin dashboard for managing bookings efficiently. The platform is designed with a clean UI, seamless form submission, and role-based access control.

🧩 Key Features:
🧑‍💼 User Side:
✅ Interactive Reservation Form: Users can book a table by entering their name, date, time, phone number, and party size.

🕓 Real-Time Form Validation: Ensures all fields are filled correctly before allowing submission.

📩 Success Message: Users receive confirmation feedback after making a reservation.

📱 Responsive UI: Mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for accessibility and responsiveness.

🌐 Single Page Application (SPA): Smooth navigation and dynamic content without full-page reloads.

🔐 Admin Panel:
🧾 View All Reservations: Admins can log in and access a list of all table bookings.

🗑️ Delete Reservations: Option to remove bookings manually.

🔍 Search & Filter: (If implemented — let me know if this is included)

🛡️ Protected Route: Admin panel is only accessible via login credentials, restricting unauthorized access.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
💻 Frontend:
React.js – Component-based structure for scalable UI

Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI – For utility-first and component-ready styling

Axios – To make HTTP requests to the backend API

🌐 Backend:
Node.js + Express.js – RESTful API server for managing reservations

MongoDB + Mongoose – Database to store and manage reservation data

🔐 Authentication:
(Add this if you implemented login functionality for the admin panel. e.g., JWT or session-based auth.)

☁️ Deployment:
Frontend (User Side): Deployed on Vercel

Admin Panel: Deployed separately on Vercel

👨‍💻 My Role:
Developed the entire full-stack application from scratch.

Designed and implemented both the user-facing site and the admin panel.

Built and connected REST APIs using Express and MongoDB.

Handled UI/UX design with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.

Deployed both frontend and backend with production-ready setup using Vercel.

🧠 What I Learned:
Managing full-stack architecture with MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

Creating protected admin routes and basic authentication flows

Building scalable REST APIs

Deploying and managing multiple environments (user + admin)

🚀 Future Improvements:
Add login functionality with JWT for better security

Add email/SMS notifications for confirmed reservations

Implement search/filter/sort features in the admin dashboard

Add calendar view for admins to track bookings visually
